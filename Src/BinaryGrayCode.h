/// \brief Binary reflected Gray code generator.
///
/// A binary Gray code generates all strings of \f$n\f$ bits in such a way that
/// each string differs from the previous one in exactly one bit.
/// This class implements a nonrecursive version of the binary reflected Gray
/// code generation algorithm from the following paper:
///
/// > Bitner, Ehrlich, and Reingold, "Efficient generation of the Binary
/// > Reflected Gray Code and its applications", _Communications of the ACM_,
/// > Vol. 19, No. 9, pp 517-521, 1976.
///
/// Note that this class has a lot of `friend`s because the Gray code generator
/// is fundamental to the exhaustive search and accessor functions would
/// just serve to slow things down.
