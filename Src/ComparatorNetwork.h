/// \brief Comparator network.
///
/// A comparator network, each level of which is represented by a matching
/// stored in an array `m_nComparator`. There is a comparator between channels
/// `j` and `k` at level `i-1` iff `m_nComparator[i][j] == k` and
/// `m_nComparator[i][k] == j`. Intuitively, `m_nComparator[i][j]` is the
/// channel that channel `j` is matched to via a comparator in level `i-1`. 
/// \image html comparator.png "A sorting network (left) and its representation as an array (right)." width=47% 
/// For example, in the above diagram at left there is a comparator between
/// channels 0 and 1 at level 1, and in the table at right
/// `m_nComparator[0][0] == 1`and `m_nComparator[0][1] == 0`.
